### Project Title

E-sports Players’ Careers, Earnings, and Digital Engagement (Worldwide)

### Motivation

The COVID-19 pandemic reshaped the e-sports industry, significantly
impacting players’ earnings, tournament availability, and digital
engagement strategies. This project aims to analyze these changes to
understand how players adapted both financially and socially in a
digital-first environment. By focusing on income fluctuations,
engagement strategies, and shifts in sponsorships, this study will
reveal the resilience and adaptability of e-sports players in the face
of global disruptions.

### Key Research Questions

- Earnings Patterns: What trends exist in overall earnings, single-game
  earnings, and earnings by country, age, and demographic (e.g., female
  players, console players)?
- Recent Earnings Trends: How have player earnings changed over the last
  30, 90, and 365 days? Are there notable fluctuations?
- Online vs. Offline: What differences are observed between online and
  offline tournament earnings, especially since COVID-19?
- Demographic and Game-Type Insights: How do earnings and participation
  vary across age groups, specialized games (e.g., fighting games,
  mobile), and demographics (e.g., female players)?
- Tournament Success: Who has the most tournament results, and how does
  this correlate with earnings across different tournament types and
  prize levels?

### Intended Final Products

- **Comprehensive Report**: A detailed documentation of our analyses on
  player careers, earnings trends, and digital engagement metrics,
  addressing our research questions.
- **Webpage with Dashboard**: A project webpage including an interactive
  analysis dashboard for data visualization and exploration.
- **Narrated Screencast**: A two-minute video highlighting the key
  analysis steps, results, and conclusions, with actionable
  recommendations for e-sports industry stakeholders.
