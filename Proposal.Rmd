### Project Title
E-sports Players’ Careers, Earnings, and Digital Engagement (Worldwide)

### Motivation
This project aims to analyze the evolving landscape of e-sports, focusing on patterns in player earnings, differences between online and offline tournaments, and engagement strategies across demographics and game types. By examining trends in income, age and gender variations, and tournament success, this study will reveal key factors influencing players' financial and social adaptability in a digital-first environment.

### Key Research Questions
- Earnings Patterns: What trends exist in overall earnings, single-game earnings, and earnings by country, age, and demographic (e.g., female players, console players)?
- Recent Earnings Trends: How have player earnings changed over the last 30, 90, and 365 days? Are there notable fluctuations?
- Online vs. Offline: What differences are observed between online and offline tournament earnings, especially since COVID-19?
- Tournament Success: Who has the most tournament results, and how does this correlate with earnings across different tournament types and prize levels?

### Intended Final Products
- **Comprehensive Report**: A detailed documentation of our analyses on player careers, earnings trends, and digital engagement metrics, addressing our research questions.
- **Webpage with Dashboard**: A project webpage including an interactive analysis dashboard for data visualization and exploration.
- **Narrated Screencast**: A two-minute video highlighting the key analysis steps, results, and conclusions, with actionable recommendations for e-sports industry stakeholders.
